## About Safezone

Safezone is a web application demo designed to help people check on friends and family during weather events and disasters. Inspired by market research, Safezone addresses the need for a unified solution that combines real-time location sharing with up-to-date disaster and safety information.

### Key Features

- **Unified Dashboard:** View friends’ and family members’ locations on a single map.
- **Real-Time Disaster Overlays:** See live weather radar, wind patterns, earthquakes, political unrest, traffic incidents, and other safety-relevant events.
- **Modern Web Technologies:** Built with Next.js for performance, scalability, and ease of development.
- **Optimized Font Loading:** Uses `next/font` and Geist for fast, accessible typography.
- **Developer-Friendly:** Simple setup, hot-reloading, and ready for deployment on Vercel.

Safezone aims to provide a secure, user-friendly environment for staying connected and informed during emergencies, reducing the need to switch between multiple apps.
